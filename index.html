        <h3>Here's a timeline of Dennis Ritchie:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>September 9,1941
          </strong> - Born in Bronxville, New York, U.S.</li></br>
        <li><strong>1967-1968</strong> - Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer.</li></br>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unix", a pun on the name "Multics".[12] To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many year.</li></br>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system.</li></br>
        <li><strong>1990</strong> - Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language".</li></br>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> - Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language".</li></br>
        <li><strong>April 21,1999</strong> - Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".</li></br>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - The Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.</li></br>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.</li></br>
        <li><strong>October 12,2011</strong> - Ritchie was found dead in his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone at the age of 70.</li>
      </ul>

        <q>Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.</q>
